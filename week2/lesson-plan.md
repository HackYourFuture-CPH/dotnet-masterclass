- Let's talk about C# Fundamentals
  - Methods (Ivan)
  - Generics (Ivan)
  - Lists (Calin)

## Exercises

### 1. [Minimal API]

### 2. [Method + Generic Method]

### 3. Distinct alphabetical list
Make a `GET` endpoint that takes a `string` as input and returns a new list containing only the unique characters, sorted in alphabetical order. For example, if the input `string` is `The cool breeze whispered through the trees`, the output should be `["b", "c", "d", "e", "h", "i", "l", "o", "p", "r", "s", "t", "u", "w", "z"]`.

### 4. Word Frequency Count
Write a `GET` endpoint that takes a `string` as input and counts the frequency of each word in the `string`. 
Your program should output a list of `objects` where each `object` contains a word and its frequency. 
For example, if the input string is "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", your program should output the following list:
`[("the", 2), ("quick", 1), ("brown", 1), ("fox", 1), ("jumps", 1), ("over", 1), ("lazy", 1), ("dog", 1)]`
