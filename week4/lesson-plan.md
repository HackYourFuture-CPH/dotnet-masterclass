# Week 4 - lesson plan: Async and await

## Agenda

1. Introduce async await - 20m
2. Showcase a `synchronous` http call using `Send()` (`https://reqres.in/api/users?delay=1`) - 10m
3. Showcase a `asynchronous` http call using `GetAsync` (`https://reqres.in/api/users?delay=1`) - 10m
4. Introduce Task - 20m
5. Showcase `missing` to await a task. E.g.: Create a loop and call an endpoint with console log => make it throw and show that the execution continues and it fails silently - 10m
6. Showcase both `async` and `sync` code executed as part of a loops - 20m
7. Showcase usage of `Task.WhenAll` and benefits (posible to evidentiate differnece by using a stopwatch) - 10m
8. Extract the logic in an interface + implementation - 20m
9. Go through exercises - rest
